        <p> Basketball: I like Basketball because you have to bounce a ball and throw it into a net which seems interesting to me and you can only use your hands. <div></div>
            Gaming: I love Gaming because it is so unique and you can explore and my favorite games are Roblox a game where there are millions of things to do, Valorant a game where you shoot people to get point and win the game and lastly Minecraft a game where you can explore build mine and more. <div id="d2"></div>
        Reading: I like Reading because the stories are always so interesting and full of mystery also i like it when there are twists in the story. <divide id="d3"></div>
